    "# Example use case\n",
    "To find the closest color in a dataset of named colors, we cannot use our usual quick-search methods or binary search-trees, since the data has more than 1 dimension and cannot simply be ordered. Therefore, we can create a tree with k dimensions, where every new level is split along a new dimension, iterating through all of them as often as needed. This allows us to very quickly get an approximation of the nearest neighbor and with slightly more effort find the exact nearest neighbor quicker than with a linear search.<br>"
