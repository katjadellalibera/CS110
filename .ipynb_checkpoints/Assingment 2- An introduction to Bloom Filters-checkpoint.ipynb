    "# Bloom Filters\n",
    "### 1. supported operations and use cases\n",
    "Bloom filters are a data structure that remembers which elements have been seen before and which ones have not, using very little space. For this, it does not store any data directly, but rather consists of many boolean values that are turned to 1 when an element is \"inserted\". Every element will have a few hash functions that determine which elements of the bloom filter to turn to true, if an element is already true, it will not change how the function works. This also means insert runs at constant time.<br> To look up an element, one simply has to hash the element and check all the corresponding positions in the bloom filter. This also runs in positive time complexity.<br> Two potential downsides of bloom filters are the fact that the \"delete\" operation is not supported, and the existence of \"phantom elements\" that will cause a false positive rate. Since we are not keeping track of which elements turned a position to True, we might search an element and think it is there because other elements turned all of its hash functions to true.<br>\n",
    "In summary, the supported operations are:\n",
    "1. insert\n",
    "2. search\n",
    "\n",
    "There are variations of bloom filters that also support deletion, but this exploration will focus on the classic case.<br>\n",
    "Use cases:<br>\n",
    "Bloom filters are useful for any situations where memory usage is expensive and the downsides of not being able to delete elements and having the possibility of false positives is not significant. Some examples are Medium keeping track of which articles a reader has already visited so they do not appear in the recommendations, or Google Chrome using Bloom filters to identify malicious URLs (used to).<br>\n",
