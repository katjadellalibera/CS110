This created two child strings, each of these strings with a single character changed from their parent. And from the two child strings, four grandchild strings were created, two from each child. The 4 grandchild strings also have a single character changed from their parents. As result, we got 7 strings but unfortunately the order of the strings has been lost.*\n",
